# VRML test files

This directory contains VRML files that can be parsed by the trajectory
simulation in the framework. The files are based on a collection of
demonstration models that are related to the development of 
[Castle Game Engine](http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/demo_models.php) and 
are licensed under the GNU GPL >=2 license. Certain files may have been 
converted to VRML using the open-source [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) 
software.
